A Management app built with React Native.

So here's what I did.
I initialized the project on master branch, a clean hello world, and created a dev branch.

some ideas for workflow - very much subject to change:

- As little code as possible in `App.js` - modular
- All the source code (apart from App.js and index.js) in `./src` directory
- keep the files clean, resonably named, categorized in directories

# And please, if this isn't a problem, @jakub remove `main` branch, it's driving me nuts its not master (so i created master) xd sorry
